## Worked example: trypsins from soil samples
 
### The starting sequences

The ready-to-run input is a single multi-FASTA of **2,330,712 protein sequences**, `soil_proteins_renamed.fasta`, available in the Zenodo deposit [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20720235](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20720235). The fasta file was downloaded and extracted to be used directly as the Stage 1 input: 
 
```bash
gunzip soil_proteins_renamed.fasta.gz
```
 
For provenance, these sequences are the predicted CDS from MGnify study [MGYS00006774](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/studies/MGYS00006774/overview). Sequence headers were cut at the first (-NODE-) to avoid very long headers, the gene number was kept so no duplicates appear in the initial dataset. The command used: 
 
```
sed -E 's/^(>[^-]+)-NODE-[^_]+_([0-9]+).*/\1_\2/' soil_proteins_combined.fasta > soil_proteins_renamed.fasta
```
 
The `.` in each header was replaced with `_` to match AlphaFold Server job-naming requirements.

### Stage 1 - filtering sequences
 
```bash
./run_stage1.sh /path/to/soil_proteins_renamed.fasta -residues GDSGGP -pfam PF00089 -identity 90
```
 
- **`-residues GDSGGP`** keeps only sequences containing the literal six-residue motif `G-D-S-G-G-P`, a highly conserved motif in trypsins. This is a fast, high-specificity first sieve. The `-residues` flag accepts regular expressions, so you could write `G.SGGP` to allow any residue in position 2.
- **`-pfam PF00089`** runs `hmmsearch` against Pfam HMM. The motif alone catches false positives that happen to contain the hexapeptide; requiring a Pfam Trypsin hit confirms the domain architecture.
- **`-identity 90`** clusters the remaining sequences at 90% identity with MMseqs2 and keeps one representative per cluster.

Stage 1 acted as a funnel and reduced the number of sequences from > 2.3 million to 166 trypsins using the above identified filters.


### Between the stages - structure prediction
 
The file extension (.pdb) and a SEQRES records within it are required fot Stage 2. Following submission of our 166 sequences to AlphaFold server, the jobs were named as the headers of the sequences (with a _ instead of the .) to match the server instructions. Gene numbers were removed from the headers of the filtered sequences as no duplicates remained in the filtered dataset. The output model_0 CIF file from each predicted structure was converted to the PDB format using GEMMI, without modifying the coordinates. Predicted structures in PDB format are available in `pdbs.tar.gz` within the Zenodo deposit [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20720235](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20720235). Original AlphaFold Server output is in `alphafold_predictions.tar.gz` in the same deposit. For the sake of testing the pipeline, the `pdbs.tar.gz` was downloaded and extracted with::

```bash
tar -xzvf pdbs.tar.gz
```

### Stage 2 - predicting properties and representatives
 
```bash
./run_stage2.sh /path/to/pdbs/ -solubility 0.69 -phopt 7:10 -topt 30:45 -tm 55 -clades 13
```
 
- **`-solubility 0.69`** NetSolP outputs solubility on a 0-1 scale.
- **`-tm 55`** asks for predicted melting temperatures of at least 55 °C. Because we passed it as a single number (cutoff mode), the score for this property is normalised across the *passing* pool, so higher Tm is rewarded.
- **`-phopt 7:10`** keeps enzymes whose predicted pH optimum sits in `[7, 10]`, with the scoring rubric most rewarding values near the midpoint (pH 8.5).
- **`-topt 30:45`** Same logic as in pH optimum but for optimum temperature.
- **`-clades 13`** partitions the resulting NJ tree into 13 clades.

 
### Reading the outputs
 
After the run, `predictions_output/` contains three files:
 
```
predictions_output/
├── all_predictions.tsv             # one row per PDB, all five predicted properties
├── all_predictions_filtered.tsv    # subset that passed our -solubility/-tm/-phopt/-topt filters
└── clade_representatives.tsv       # one winner per clade among the filtered enzymes
```

#### Column reference for the merged tables

| Column | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ID` | PDB filename stem | Canonical identifier. |
| `chain_id` | derived from SEQRES | Only present in the multi-chain table. |
| `predicted_solubility` | NetSolP | 0-1, higher = more soluble. |
| `predicted_usability` | NetSolP | 0-1, higher = more usable. |
| `predicted_ph_opt` | pHoptNN | Predicted optimal pH. |
| `predicted_topt_C` | Seq2Topt | Predicted optimum temperature, °C. |
| `predicted_tm_C` | Seq2Tm | Predicted melting temperature, °C. |
| `score` | EnzymeSifter | Combined score over user-specified filters, `[0, 1]`. |
| `n_eligible_in_clade` | EnzymeSifter | How many single-sequence PDBs in this clade passed filters. |
| `n_members_in_clade` | EnzymeSifter | Total tips in this clade. |

`NA` indicates that a particular predictor could not score that enzyme (e.g. an excessively long sequence skipped by CLEAN's 1022-aa limit).

NetSolP predictions in the pipeline exhibit small numerical variations at around 0.01 on average compared to the webserver and across CPU microarchitectures attributable to INT8 quantized ONNX kernel dis-patch.
 
`clade_representatives.tsv` is the answer to "give me a structurally diverse shortlist of trypsins that satisfy my biophysical criteria". Each row reports the winning PDB for one clade, its combined score in `[0, 1]`, how many filter-passing enzymes were available in that clade (`n_eligible_in_clade`), how many total members the clade has (`n_members_in_clade`), and the predicted values for that enzyme. Clades with no passing members appear with `ID = NA`, so it tells you that no member of this clade passed the filters. If the number of clades defined by the user is not achievable due to tree topology, the tool returns the closest attainable clade number but do not exceed the number defined by the user. 

The coloured tree PNG with stars marking the clade representatives lives in `data/trees/`. A typical follow-up at this point is to open `data/trees/nj_tree_clades.png`, scan which clades produced winners and which didn't, and use that to decide whether your filters were too strict, whether to repeat Stage 2 with different filters, or whether the winners are ready for synthesis. The entire output of the test run is available at the Supplementary data of EnzymeSifter published paper.

## Stage 1 options reference
 
```
Usage: ./run_stage1.sh <input> [options]
       ./run_stage1.sh -l <list_file> [options]
```
 
`<input>` can be either a single FASTA (`.fasta` / `.fa` / `.faa`) or a directory containing one or more such files.
Alternatively, use **`-l <list_file>`** with a text file containing paths of all FASTA files to process each FASTA into its own `<sample_name>/` folder.
All filtering options are independent; supplying none of them runs Stage 1 as a passthrough that simply writes the input back out.
 
### `-residues <motif>`
 
Keep only sequences whose amino-acid string matches a regex motif (case-insensitive), `.` matches any single residue.

Examples:
 
```bash
-residues GDSGGP        # literal hexapeptide
-residues G.S.G         # GxSxG
```
 
The matching position is recorded in `data/stage1/motif_report.tsv`, which is handy when you want to confirm the position of the motif.
 
### `-pfam <IDs>`
 
Comma-separated list of Pfam accessions in `PFXXXXX` form. Sequences are kept if they hit any of the listed accessions.
 
```bash
-pfam PF00089                   # Trypsin
-pfam PF00089,PF07519           # Trypsin OR Tannase
```
 
### `-ec <IDs>`
 
Comma-separated list of EC numbers, partial specs are wildcards:
 
| Spec | Means |
|---|---|
| `3.13.1.8` | Exactly EC 3.13.1.8 |
| `3.13.-.-` | Any EC starting with `3.13.` |
| `3.13` | Same as `3.13.-.-` |
| `3` | Any EC in class 3 (Hydrolases) |
 
Multiple specs use OR logic:
 
```bash
-ec 3.13.-.-,2.5.1.94
```
 
- CLEAN's underlying ESM-1b embedder caps sequences at 1022 residues. Longer sequences are *skipped* with a warning and marked `SKIPPED_TOO_LONG` in the EC report.

### `-identity <pct>`
 
Cluster sequences with MMseqs2 at `<pct>`% identity and keep one representative per cluster. The full cluster membership in clustering_report.tsv has two columns: `representative` and `member`.
 
### Filter order
 
When multiple flags are combined, they always apply in this fixed order:
 
```
-residues  →  -pfam  →  -ec  →  -identity
```
 
The cheap filters run first so the expensive predictors only see sequences that already passed the simpler tests.

## Stage 2 options reference
 
```
Usage: ./run_stage2.sh /path/to/pdbs [filter options] [clade options]
       ./run_stage2.sh -l <list_file> [filter options] [clade options]
```
 
`/path/to/pdbs` must be a directory containing the `.pdb` files. Alternatively, supply **`-l <list_file>`** with the list of FASTA files (or PDB directories); Stage 2 will run for each sample and output to its respective `<sample_name>/` directory. The filename becomes the canonical `ID` downstream, so make sure filenames are descriptive and stable. Multi-chain PDBs are supported - Stage 2 will produce per-chain plus per-structure output tables automatically.
 
If you pass no other flags, Stage 2 still runs all four property predictors plus EnzyMM, the MUSCLE alignment, and the NJ tree - it just doesn't filter or pick representatives.
 
### Filter options
 
All filters are optional. Supplying any of them does **two** things:
 
1. Filters `predictions_output/all_predictions.tsv` (or the multi-chain pair) into a `*_filtered.tsv`.
2. Defines the scoring rubric used for clade-representative selection (best when combined with `-clades`).

#### `-solubility <min>` *(cutoff only)*
 
Keep enzymes whose NetSolP-predicted solubility is ≥ `<min>`.
 
#### `-usability <min>` *(cutoff only)*
 
Keep enzymes whose NetSolP-predicted *usability* is ≥ `<min>`.

#### `-tm <value>` *(cutoff **or** interval)*
 
The only flag that accepts both forms:
 
- `-tm 40` - cutoff: keep enzymes with `Tm ≥ 55 °C`. Higher = better in the score.
- `-tm 50:80` - interval: keep enzymes with `50 °C ≤ Tm ≤ 80 °C`. Closer to the midpoint (65 °C) = better in the score.
Use the cutoff when "more thermostable is always better". Use the interval when you have an upper bound.
 
#### `-topt <lo:hi>` *(interval only)*
 
Predicted optimal operating temperature in °C. Must be an interval.
 
#### `-phopt <lo:hi>` *(interval only)*
 
Predicted optimal pH. Must be an interval.
 
### Clade options
 
#### `-clades <n>`
 
Partition the NJ tree into `n` clades by binary-searching the smallest tip-distance threshold that yields ≤ `n` clades, and:
 
- write `data/clades/clade_assignments.tsv` (one row per tip)
- render `data/trees/nj_tree_clades.png` with tips coloured by clade
- if filter options are also present, write `predictions_output/clade_representatives.tsv` containing the best-scoring filter-passing enzyme per clade, and overlay ★ markers on the tree at each representative
The pipeline emits a warning if `n` clades can't be produced exactly - usually because the tree topology forces a slightly different cut.
 
### How scoring works
 
Whenever filter flags are given, every filter-passing enzyme receives a score in `[0, 1]` per specified property:
 
- **Cutoff properties** (`solubility`, `usability`, `tm` in cutoff mode): score is the property's value normalised across the passing pool - `(value - pool_min) / (pool_max - pool_min)`. So `1.0` goes to the best enzyme in the pool.
- **Interval properties** (`phopt`, `topt`, `tm` in interval mode): score is `1 - |value - midpoint| / half_width`, so being at the centre of the requested range = `1.0`, being at the edge = `0.0`.
The combined score is the arithmetic mean of the per-property scores across the user-specified properties, ignoring any property the predictor returned as `NA` for that enzyme. Multi-sequence PDBs (heteromeric assemblies) are excluded from representative selection because their per-chain scores can't be meaningfully averaged into a single structure-level value.
